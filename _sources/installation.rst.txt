Installation
============

wis2box is built for easy installation across various operating systems and environments.

Requirements and dependencies
-----------------------------

wis2box requires `Python`_ 3 and `Docker`_ 1.13+.

Core dependencies are installed as containers in the Docker Compose deployment of wis2box. This
is true for the software wis2box itself, which runs as a container orchestrating the necessary
data management workflows of a node as part of the WIS 2.0 network.

Once Python and Docker are installed, wis2box needs to be installed.
