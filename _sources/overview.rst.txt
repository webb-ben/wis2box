Overview
========

wis2box is a Python reference implementation of a WMO WIS 2.0 node. The project provides a
plug and play toolset to ingest, process, and publish weather/climate/water data using
standards-based approaches in alignment with the `WIS 2.0 principles`_. In addition, wis2box
also provides access to all data in the WIS 2.0 network, from other wis2box instances and
global centres.

wis2box is designed to have a low barrier to entry for data providers, providing enabling
infrastructure and services for data discovery, access, and visualization.
